                <p>Projects that I have been proud of is 
                my database project, where I worked with 
                my team members on conceptual design,
                the ERD we created, query feasibility, 
                logical design, and normalization. We also 
                had to give the differences between ERD and 
                normalized relations, database integrity, 
                physical design/implementation, data dictionary
                and denormalization. For the last step we addressed
                challlenged that we faced, along with strengths and 
                weaknesses encountered during implementation. We also
                had a team contract, data dictionary model, and project 
                management where we displayed how we used our time throughout 
                our project.</p>
